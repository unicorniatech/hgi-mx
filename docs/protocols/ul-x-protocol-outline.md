# UL-X Protocol (Outline Only)

TODO: Outline placeholder for UL-X protocol.

- Purpose: Provide a versionable protocol scaffold.
- No implementation logic.

Traycer:
- Expand sections as headings/notes only unless architect authorizes specs.
- Require MCP REF + MCP EXA for any implementation tasks.
