# UI Placeholder

TODO: This directory will host the client/UI surface for hgi-mx.

- Do not implement UI logic until instructed.
- Any code generation/modification must use MCP REF + MCP EXA.

Traycer:
- When creating UI tasks, reference `/docs/roadmap/roadmap-v1.md` and `/docs/core/*`.
- Keep tasks atomic and versionable.
